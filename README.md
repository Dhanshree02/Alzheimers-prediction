# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction  

This project aims to predict Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various health-related features, which are analyzed and used to build predictive models.  

## Project Overview  

- **Data Exploration**  
  - Loaded and cleaned the dataset.  
  - Checked for missing values and categorized features into numerical and categorical.  
  - Visualized data distribution to understand key patterns.  

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Encoded categorical variables and standardized numerical features.  
  - Handled class imbalance, if necessary.  

- **Model Development**  
  - Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning models.  
  - Assessed model performance using classification metrics.  

- **Results & Insights**  
  - Identified key factors contributing to Alzheimer's diagnosis.  
  - Visualized model performance and potential improvements.  

## Requirements  

- Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
